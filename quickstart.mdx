#### **Step 2: Run Your First Workflow**

Let's start with a simple workflow from Workflow Library to identify image improvement insights from competitor images:

1. Navigate to **Workflow Library** in Workflows section

   ![Workflowlibrarybutton Pn](/images/Workflowlibrarybutton.png)
2. Click on the following workflow to see its logic/steps: **"Identify Image Improvement Insights From Competitor Images"** (screenshot)
3. **Add the Workflow** to your account (screenshot)
4. Find the newly added workflow in your "Workflows" section and click \*\*"Run now" \*\*(screenshot)
5. **Select ASINs** from the list (sort by sales if needed) or paste your required ASIN (screenshot)
6. A new tab will open showing the workflow Output being generated in the **Output** section (this takes a few minutes) (screenshot)

_Note: The Agent can also take Actions for workflows that include PPC actions, price changes, or listing updates. See the Viewing Outputs & Taking Actions section for details._

#### **Step 3: Create Your First Custom Workflow**

Let's create a custom workflow to update bullet points using relevant competitor ranking keywords:

1. Navigate to **Agent**
2. Type the following prompt:\
   \
   _"Identify 7-8 top competitors for my ASIN with similar features and pricing. Find the keywords they rank for within the top 30 organic positions. Filter keywords directly relevant to my product with a search volume over 500. Integrate these keywords into my bullet points naturally, making only minimal changes to the existing bullets."_

   _ASINs to run this workflow can be selected after the workflow is finalized._
3. **Review the Steps** suggested by the Agent and make changes if needed. If not, ask the Agent to generate the test output.

   _Don't worryâ€”the Agent won't execute anything automatically._
5. You can **Approve** the bullet point suggestions to make these changes live on Seller Central (no separate manual action required).

6. To run the workflow on specific ASINs, select new ASINs to run the workflow on.

7. To save this workflow for future use, ask the Agent to **Save** it. To schedule it as recurring task, use the **Schedule** option.

   ![Save&scheduleworkflow Pn](/images/Save&scheduleworkflow.png)
8. Once saved, the new Workflow will show up in the Workflows list and any output generated from the Saved workflow will show up in the Output section

#### **Step 4: Edit a Workflow**

Let's edit a workflow from our list of Workflows:

1. Navigate to **My Workflows**
3. Open any Workflow and click **"Edit Workflow"** and tell your required edits to the Agent.

   _ASINs to run this workflow can be selected after the workflow is finalized._
4. Review the steps suggested by the Agent and make changes if needed. If not, ask the Agent to generate the test output.
