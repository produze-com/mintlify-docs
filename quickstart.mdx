#### **Step 1: Connect Your Amazon Account**

1. Log into Superfuel and find the Amazon Connections section
2. Connect your Amazon account by logging in with an email that has permissions for external apps
3. See [detailed instructions with screenshots here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/137TOFFlkxpc9R7fDQj-zB2SXNGYFkQKoC__e53agkdw/edit?usp=sharing)

#### **Step 2: Run Your First Workflow**

Let's start with a simple workflow to identify image improvement insights from competitor images:

1. Navigate to **Workflow Library** in Workflows section 

   ![Workflowlibrarybutton Pn](/images/Workflowlibrarybutton.png)
2. Click on the following workflow to see its logic/steps: **"Identify Image Improvement Insights From Competitor Images"**
3. Add the workflow to your account (screenshot)
4. Find the newly added workflow in your "Workflows" section and click \*\*"Run now" \*\*(screenshot)
5. Select ASINs from the list (sort by sales if needed) or paste your required ASIN (screenshot)
6. A new tab will open showing the workflow Output being generated in the Output section (this takes a few minutes) (screenshot)

_Note: The Agent can also take Actions for workflows that include PPC actions, price changes, or listing updates. See the Viewing Outputs & Taking Actions section for details._

#### **Step 3: Create Your First Custom Workflow**

Let's create a simple workflow to update bullet points using relevant competitor ranking keywords:

1. Navigate to \*\*Agent \*\*
2. Type the following prompt: (screenshot)\
   \
   \
   "Identify 7-8 top competitors for my ASIN with similar features and pricing. Find the keywords they rank for within the top 30 organic positions. Filter keywords directly relevant to my product with a search volume over 500. Integrate these keywords into my bullet points naturally, making only minimal changes to the existing bullets."\
   \
   \
   _ASINs to run this workflow can be selected after the workflow is finalized._
3. Review the steps suggested by the Agent and make changes if needed. If not, ask the Agent to generate the test output. (screenshot)\
   \
   _Don't worry—the Agent won't execute anything automatically._
4. Review the test output to see if you need any changes. If you need changes, ask the Agent to modify the steps to generate your expected output. The Agent will run the "steps + test output" loop again to generate new output based on your requirements. (screenshot)
5. To run the workflow on specific ASINs, select new ASINs to run the workflow on. (screenshot)
6. You can **Approve** the bullet point suggestions to make these changes live on Seller Central (no separate manual action required). (screenshot)
7. To save this workflow for future use or schedule it as recurring, use the schedule option. (screenshot)
8. Once saved, the new Workflow will show up in the Workflows list and any output generated from the Saved workflow will show up in the Output section (2 screenshots)

#### **Step 4: Edit a Workflow**

Let's edit a workflow from the Workflow Library:

1. Navigate to **Workflow Library**
2. Add any workflow to your account
3. Find the newly added workflow in your "Workflows" section. Open the workflow and click **"Edit Workflow"**. Type your required edits to the Agent. (screenshot)\
   \
   _ASINs to run this workflow can be selected after the workflow is finalized._
4. Review the steps suggested by the Agent and make changes if needed. If not, ask the Agent to generate the test output. \
   \
   _Don't worry—the Agent won't execute anything automatically._
5. Review the test output to see if you need any changes. If you need changes, ask the Agent to modify the steps to generate your expected output. The Agent will run the "steps + test output" loop again to generate new output based on your requirements. (screenshot)
6. To run the workflow on specific ASINs, select new ASINs to run the workflow on.
7. To save this workflow for future use or schedule it as recurring, use the schedule option.

## Get started in three steps

Get your documentation site running locally and make your first customization.

### Step 1: Set up your local environment

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Clone your docs locally" icon="copy">
    During the onboarding process, you created a GitHub repository with your docs content if you didn't already have one. You can find a link to this repository in your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com).

    To clone the repository locally so that you can make and preview changes to your docs, follow the [Cloning a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) guide in the GitHub docs.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Start the preview server" icon="rectangle-terminal">
    1. Install the Mintlify CLI: `npm i -g mint`
    2. Navigate to your docs directory and run: `mint dev`
    3. Open `http://localhost:3000` to see your docs live!

    <Tip>
      Your preview updates automatically as you edit files.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Step 2: Deploy your changes

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Install our GitHub app" icon="github">
    Install the Mintlify GitHub app from your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/organization/github-app).

    Our GitHub app automatically deploys your changes to your docs site, so you don't need to manage deployments yourself.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Update your site name and colors" icon="palette">
    For a first change, let's update the name and colors of your docs site.

    1. Open `docs.json` in your editor.
    2. Change the `"name"` field to your project name.
    3. Update the `"colors"` to match your brand.
    4. Save and see your changes instantly at `http://localhost:3000`.

    <Tip>
      Try changing the primary color to see an immediate difference!
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Step 3: Go live

<Accordion title="Publish your docs" icon="rocket">
  1. Commit and push your changes.
  2. Your docs will update and be live in moments!
</Accordion>
