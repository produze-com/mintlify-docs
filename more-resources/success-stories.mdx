title: "Best practices"

What we've learned from sellers who've successfully integrated Superfuel into their operations:

### They start where they are

The most successful users start with what they do manually today. They:

1. List out the major manual tasks their team does daily
2. Write 3-4 bullet points on how they currently handle each task
3. Ask the agent to replicate these exact steps

**Example**: They start simple - "Check if our top 5 ASINs are Buy Box eligible every morning" rather than building complex competitive analysis from scratch.

### They treat the Agent like training a new team member

Their agent needs guidance to work their way. Top users:

1. Modify each workflow 6-7 times until output matches their standards
2. Provide specific instructions like they would with a human employee
3. Start with tasks they're already doing, not wishlist items

### They build daily rhythms

Sellers getting real value have made the agent part of their routine:

3. Start their day reviewing Agent-generated insights
2. Delete workflows that create noise without value
4. Make agent insights and recommendations a part of their team meetings

### They scale gradually but consistently

Sustainable automation happens through steady progress. They:

1. Add 3-5 new workflows weekly
2. Set goals for team members to automate 20% of manual work monthly
3. Mark ~70% of execution tasks as "Approve All"
4. Explore automation before hiring new team members - can the agent handle what a new hire would do?

### They make it a team sport

The most successful users involve everyone. They:

1. Add all team members and train them 
2. Run internal challenges on who can automate the most
3. Share wins and learnings across the team

### What results look like for our top users

Sellers following these practices have seen:

- **Sales growth of ~15%**
- **Profitability increase of ~10%**
- **40% more output with same team**
