#### **Step 1: Run Your First Workflow From Workflow Library**

Let's start with a simple Workflow to identify image improvement insights from competitor images:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Workflow Library" titleSize="p">
    You'll find Workflow Library in the Workflows section
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click on a Workflow to see its logic and steps" titleSize="p">
    Click on "Identify Image Improvement Insights From Competitor Images" to see its logic/steps
  </Step>
  <Step title='"Add" the Workflow to your account '>
    
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run the new Workflow">
    Find the newly added workflow in your "Workflows" section and click "Run now"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select ASINs">
    Select ASINs from the list (sort by sales if needed) or paste your required ASINs
  </Step>
  <Step title="See the new Output tab">
    A new Output tab will open with the Workflow's output for your selected ASIN (output generation will take a few minutes)
  </Step>
  <Step title="View the Output">
    View the Output by expanding the details section, then scrolling to the right and clicking on "View"
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  The Agent can also take Actions after your Approval for workflows in PPC, pricing, or listing. The next Workflow in Step 2 includes one with an action to execute.
</Note>

#### **Step 2: Create Your First Custom Workflow**

Let's create a custom workflow to update bullet points using relevant competitor ranking keywords:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Agent">
    
  </Step>
  <Step title="Send a simple prompt to the Agent">
    Type in the following prompt:

    _"Identify 7-8 top competitors for my ASIN with similar features and pricing. Find the keywords they rank for within the top 30 organic positions. Filter keywords directly relevant to my product with a search volume over 500. Integrate these keywords into my bullet points naturally, making only minimal changes to the existing bullets."_

    _ASINs for the workflow can be provided upfront in the first message, or selected from the master ASIN list after the test output is generated._
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review the Steps proposed by the Agent">
    Review the steps and ask the Agent to make changes if needed. If no changes are required, tell the Agent to go ahead with generating the test output.

    The Agent will generate output on random 4-5 ASINs to show what the output looks like. If you're happy with the output, you can select specific ASINs you want to run the workflow on.

    <Check>
      Don't worry, the Agent won't execute anything automatically. It will execute only after your approval once you review the output.
    </Check>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review the test output">
    Click on view to see specific ASIN's Workflow output

    ![Bulletpointworkflowoutputview Pn](/images/Bulletpointworkflowoutputview.png)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Approve the output, or continue refining the Workflow">
    You can Approve the bullet point suggestions to make these changes live on Seller Central (no separate manual action required).

    ![Approvebulletpointworkflowoutput Pn](/images/Approvebulletpointworkflowoutput.png)

    If the output is not per your expectation, continue chatting with the Agent and mention what exactly needs to be improved in the Workflow.

    ![Editingfirstworkflowsteps Pn](/images/Editingfirstworkflowsteps.png)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select specific ASINs to run the workflow">
    To run the workflow on specific ASINs, click on "Change ASINs".

    ![Change ASI Nsnavigation Pn](/images/ChangeASINsnavigation.png)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save the Workflow">
    To save this workflow for future use, ask the Agent to Save it.

    ![Saveworkflow Pn](/images/Saveworkflow.png)

    Once you Save it, the Workflow will show up in "My Workflows", so you can run it again or schedule it.

    ![Newworkflowaddedtomyworkflows Pn](/images/Newworkflowaddedtomyworkflows.png)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Schedule the Workflow">
    To schedule it as recurring task, use the Schedule option.

    ![Scheduleworkflow Pn](/images/Scheduleworkflow.png)

    You can schedule it to be run daily, weekly or monthly. You can select all the ASINs you want to run the scheduled workflow on.
