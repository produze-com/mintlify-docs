A workflow is an automation consisting of sequential steps that fetch data, perform analysis, and execute actions. Think of it as your personal Amazon assistant following a process you've created.

You can build your own workflows using the Agent or use popular workflows from the Workflow Library.

#### **Workflow Capabilities**

**Data Fetching:**

- **Seller Central**: Pull metrics, reports, and account data via API
- **Amazon Shopper Site**: Collect data from competitor listings, search results, and category nodes
- **Google Sheets**: Access data like inventory levels, COGS, and custom data
- **Jungle Scout**: Get competitor ranking keywords, their ranks, and search volumes
- **Keepa**: Retrieve historical BSR, pricing, and sales estimates

**Actions & Outputs:**

- Update listings (titles, bullets, descriptions)
- Manage PPC (launch campaigns, adjust bids, add negatives)
- Adjust pricing dynamically
- Generate tabular dashboards with analytics

#### **Workflow Examples**

**Example 1: Add Negative Exact for Irrelevant Search Terms With High Clicks**

1. Identify search terms with zero sales and clicks above the campaign conversion threshold
2. Check if the search terms are relevant to my product
3. Check if my advertised product is competitive with other search results for this search term
4. If keywords are not relevant or the advertised product is not competitive, add this search term as a negative exact in the ad group

**Example 2: Identify Image Improvement Insights From Competitor Images**

1. Identify the top 10 competitors for my ASIN
2. Analyze my product and competitor product reviews to see what customers value most
3. Compare my images with competitors' to identify what competitors highlight that's missing in my listing and overlaps with what customers value most
4. Provide suggestions on what to improve in my images for better conversion

**Example 3: Inventory Dispatch Recommendations**

1. Get the latest inventory level in Amazon for my ASINs
2. Get the highest sales run rate by looking at sales for the last 7, 30, and 60 days
3. Consider my minimum days of inventory required in Amazon as 45 days and transit to Amazon as 30 days
4. Check how much inventory is available in my own warehouse from this Google Sheet (Google Sheet link)
5. Based on current inventory level, sales run rate, and minimum days of inventory, recommend how much inventory needs to be dispatched

**Example 4: Reprice Products Based on Inventory Levels**

1. Get the latest inventory level in Amazon for my ASINs
2. Get the highest sales run rate by looking at sales for the last 7, 30, and 60 days
3. If inventory days are above 90 days, reduce price by 10%
4. If inventory days are below 30 days, increase price by 10%
5. Execute the price change on Amazon
