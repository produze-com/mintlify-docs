#### **Top Workflows**

_Note: Any library workflow can be customized to match your required process. First, add the library workflow to your list of workflows, and then use the “Edit Workflow” functionality._

**1. Add Negative Exact for Irrelevant Search Terms With High Clicks**

- **Description**: Identifies search terms generating high clicks but no or low sales. Like a team member, the Agent checks whether the search term is relevant to your product and whether your product is competitive with other search results.
- **Expected outcome**: Reduce ACOS by 15-25%

**2. Optimize Bullet Points With Relevant Competitor Ranking Keywords**

- **Description**: Identifies your top-performing competitors. Finds keywords they rank for via Jungle Scout. Identifies important keywords with good organic rank and search volume. Rechecks keyword relevance and includes them in bullet points with minimal changes.
- **Expected outcome**: Improve organic rank and traffic by 10-15%

**3. Launch Exact Match Campaigns Using Competitor Ranking Keywords**

- **Description**: Identifies your top-performing competitors. Finds keywords they rank for via Jungle Scout. Identifies important keywords with good organic rank and search volume. Checks if these keywords are already targeted in existing campaigns. If not, launches campaigns with these keywords.
- **Expected outcome**: Improve sales by 5-10%

**4. Identify Image Improvement Insights From Competitor Images**

- **Description**: Identifies your top competitors. Analyzes customer reviews to find what customers value most in the product. Analyzes your images versus competitors to find what competitors include that's missing in your images but mentioned as important by customers in reviews.
- **Expected outcome**: Improve CTR and CVR by 10%

**5. Generate Backend Keywords for ASINs**

- **Description**: Identifies your top competitor ASINs, extracts their ranking keywords with ranks and search volumes, then tokenizes those keywords and filters out stopwords, prohibited/branded terms, plus anything already used in the main ASIN's copy. Creates a single string targeting 490-500 characters from the remaining set.
- **Expected outcome**: Improve organic traffic by 5%

**6. Identify Key Changes or Issues in Listings**

- **Description**: Compares your listings week over week to identify any changes to listing title, bullets, images, ratings, reviews, category node, pricing, or buybox. You can add another condition to alert these changes only if CVR or sales have dropped.
- **Expected outcome**: Prevent drop in planned sales

**7. Report FBA Fee Changes for ASINs**

- **Description**: Compares your FBA costs week over week to identify any FBA cost increases.
- **Expected outcome**: Reduce FBA costs by 2%
