Lets edit a Workflow from our list of Workflows:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to My Workflows, and open any workflow you want to edit">
    ![Newworkflowaddedtomyworkflows Pn](/images/Newworkflowaddedtomyworkflows.png)

    <Info>
      If you're looking to edit a workflow from "Workflow Library", you have to add it to "My Workflows" first.
    </Info>
  </Step>
  <Step title='Click "Edit Workflow"'>
    ![Editworkflow Pn](/images/Editworkflow.png)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Tell the Agent the changes you want in the Workflow or Output">
    ![Workfloweditfromlibrary Pn](/images/Workfloweditfromlibrary.png)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review the revised Steps proposed by the Agent">
    Review the steps and ask the Agent to make changes if needed. If no changes are required, tell the Agent to go ahead with generating the test output.

    The Agent will generate output on random 4-5 ASINs to show what the output looks like. If you're happy with the output, you can select specific ASINs you want to run the workflow on.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Continue refining the Workflow and Output">
    If the output is not per your expectation, continue chatting with the Agent and mention what more needs to be improved in the Workflow.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Save the Workflow">
    Once you're happy with the output you can ask the Agent to save the workflow.

    ![Saveworkflow Pn](/images/Saveworkflow.png)

    Once you Save it, the Workflow will continue to show in "My Workflows", maybe with a **Revised Workflow Name**.
