  </Step>
  <Step title='Click on the Workflow "Identify Image Improvement Insights From Competitor Images" to see its logic/steps' titleSize="p">

  <Step title='"Add" the Workflow to your account '>
    
  </Step>
  <Step title='Find the newly added workflow in your "Workflows" section and click "Run now"'>
    
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select ASINs from the list (sort by sales if needed) or paste your required ASINs ">
    
  </Step>
  <Step title="A new tab will open with the Workflow output in the Output section (output generation will take a few minutes) ">
    
  </Step>
  <Step title='View the output by expanding the details section, scrolling to the right and clicking on "View"'>
    
  </Step>
</Steps>

#### **Step 2: Create Your First Custom Workflow**

Let's create a custom workflow to update bullet points using relevant competitor ranking keywords:

1. Navigate to **Agent**
2. Type in the following prompt in Agent chat:\
   \
   _"Identify 7-8 top competitors for my ASIN with similar features and pricing. Find the keywords they rank for within the top 30 organic positions. Filter keywords directly relevant to my product with a search volume over 500. Integrate these keywords into my bullet points naturally, making only minimal changes to the existing bullets."_

   _ASINs for the workflow can be provided upfront in the first message or selected from the account ASIN list after the workflow steps are finalized._
3. **Review the Steps** proposed by the Agent and make changes if needed. If no changes, ask the Agent to generate the test output.

   _Don't worry, the Agent won't execute anything automatically. It will execute only after your approval after you see the output._
5. You can **Approve** the bullet point suggestions to make these changes live on Seller Central (no separate manual action required).

6. To run the workflow on specific ASINs, select new ASINs to run the workflow on.

7. To save this workflow for future use, ask the Agent to **Save** it. To schedule it as recurring task, use the **Schedule** option.

   ![Save&scheduleworkflow Pn](/images/Save&scheduleworkflow.png)
8. Once saved, the new Workflow will show up in the Workflows list and any output generated from the Saved workflow will show up in the Output section

#### **Step 4: Edit a Workflow**

Let's edit a workflow from our list of Workflows:

1. Navigate to **My Workflows**
3. Open any Workflow and click **"Edit Workflow"** and tell your required edits to the Agent.

   _ASINs to run this workflow can be selected after the workflow is finalized._
4. Review the steps suggested by the Agent and make changes if needed. If not, ask the Agent to generate the test output.
